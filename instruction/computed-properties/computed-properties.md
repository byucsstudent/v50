# Computed Properties

Computed properties are a powerful feature in Svelte that allow you to derive new values from existing data based on reactive dependencies.  They are essentially functions that automatically recalculate their value whenever any of the variables they depend on change. This ensures that your UI always reflects the most up-to-date information without the need for manual updates. Computed properties are declared using the `$:` syntax.

## Understanding the Basics

At their core, computed properties are reactive declarations that combine the benefits of reactive statements and derived values. Unlike regular variables, they don't store a static value. Instead, they hold a recipe for calculating a value based on other reactive values. This recipe is automatically re-executed whenever any of its dependencies change, ensuring the computed property always reflects the current state of the application.

Consider a scenario where you have a `firstName` and `lastName` variable, and you want to display the `fullName`. Instead of manually updating `fullName` whenever either `firstName` or `lastName` changes, you can use a computed property:

```svelte
<script>
  let firstName = 'John';
  let lastName = 'Doe';

  $: fullName = `${firstName} ${lastName}`;
</script>

<input bind:value={firstName} />
<input bind:value={lastName} />

<h1>Hello, {fullName}!</h1>
```

In this example, whenever `firstName` or `lastName` is updated through the input fields, the `fullName` computed property automatically recalculates and updates the displayed greeting.

## Benefits of Using Computed Properties

*   **Automatic Updates:** Computed properties automatically recalculate when their dependencies change, eliminating the need for manual updates and reducing the risk of inconsistencies.
*   **Readability and Maintainability:** They clearly express derived values, making your code more readable and easier to understand.  This separation of concerns improves maintainability.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Svelte's reactivity system is highly optimized. Computed properties only recalculate when necessary, preventing unnecessary computations and improving performance.
*   **Declarative Approach:** Using computed properties promotes a declarative style of programming, where you define *what* you want to compute rather than *how* to compute it. This leads to more concise and expressive code.

## Practical Examples

Let's explore a few more practical examples to solidify your understanding.

### Example 1: Calculating Total Price

Imagine you have a list of items, each with a price and quantity. You can use a computed property to calculate the total price of all items in the cart:

```svelte
<script>
  let items = [
    { name: 'Apple', price: 1.0, quantity: 2 },
    { name: 'Banana', price: 0.5, quantity: 5 },
    { name: 'Orange', price: 0.75, quantity: 3 }
  ];

  $: totalPrice = items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price * item.quantity, 0);
</script>

<ul>
  {#each items as item}
    <li>{item.name}: ${item.price} x {item.quantity}</li>
  {/each}
</ul>

<p>Total Price: ${totalPrice.toFixed(2)}</p>
```

In this example, the `totalPrice` computed property automatically updates whenever the `items` array changes, or when the `price` or `quantity` of any item within the array changes.

### Example 2: Filtering a List

You can use computed properties to create filtered lists based on user input. For instance, you can filter a list of products based on a search term:

```svelte
<script>
  let products = [
    { name: 'Laptop', category: 'Electronics' },
    { name: 'T-Shirt', category: 'Clothing' },
    { name: 'Mouse', category: 'Electronics' },
    { name: 'Jeans', category: 'Clothing' }
  ];

  let searchTerm = '';

  $: filteredProducts = products.filter(product =>
    product.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase())
  );
</script>

<input bind:value={searchTerm} placeholder="Search products..." />

<ul>
  {#each filteredProducts as product}
    <li>{product.name} ({product.category})</li>
  {/each}
</ul>
```

Here, the `filteredProducts` computed property updates automatically as the user types in the search input.

## Common Challenges and Solutions

While computed properties are powerful, there are a few common challenges you might encounter:

*   **Circular Dependencies:** Avoid creating circular dependencies where one computed property depends on another, which in turn depends on the first. This can lead to infinite loops and performance issues. Svelte will often detect these and provide a warning.  Carefully review your dependencies to break the cycle.

*   **Performance with Large Datasets:**  If you're working with very large datasets, complex computed properties can impact performance. Consider optimizing your calculations or using techniques like memoization (caching the results of expensive computations) if necessary.  However, often the performance gains from Svelte's reactivity will outweigh the cost of the computation.

*   **Understanding Reactivity:**  It's crucial to understand how Svelte's reactivity system works.  Make sure you're updating variables in a way that triggers reactivity. For example, when updating an array, use methods like `push`, `pop`, `splice`, or reassign the entire array to trigger updates.

## Best Practices

*   **Keep Computed Properties Simple:**  Aim for simple and focused computed properties.  If a computed property becomes too complex, consider breaking it down into smaller, more manageable units.
*   **Avoid Side Effects:**  Computed properties should primarily be used for calculating values.  Avoid performing side effects (e.g., modifying global variables, making API calls) within computed properties.
*   **Use Descriptive Names:**  Give your computed properties descriptive names that clearly indicate what they calculate.
*   **Test Your Computed Properties:**  Write unit tests to ensure your computed properties are working correctly and producing the expected results.

## Summary

Computed properties are a fundamental part of Svelte's reactive programming model. By understanding how they work and following best practices, you can write cleaner, more efficient, and more maintainable Svelte applications. They simplify data management and ensure your UI remains consistent with your application's state. Experiment with different scenarios and gradually incorporate them into your projects to unlock their full potential.

Now, try some exercises:

1.  Create a component that calculates the area of a rectangle based on user-inputted width and height. Use computed properties to display the area.
2.  Build a component that filters a list of users based on multiple criteria (e.g., name, age, location). Use computed properties to combine the filtering logic.
3.  Explore using computed properties within stores for more complex state management scenarios.

By practicing with these examples and exploring different use cases, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how to effectively utilize computed properties in your Svelte projects. Remember to focus on clarity, simplicity, and testability to ensure your code is robust and maintainable.
