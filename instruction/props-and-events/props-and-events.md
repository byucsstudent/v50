# Props and Events

This module explores the fundamental concepts of props and events, which are essential for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces using component-based architectures. You'll learn how to pass data down from parent components to child components using props, and how to communicate actions and updates back up from child components to parent components using events. Understanding these concepts is crucial for creating reusable, maintainable, and scalable applications.

## Props: Passing Data Down

Props (short for properties) are a mechanism for passing data from a parent component to a child component. Think of them as arguments that you pass to a function.  They are read-only from the child component's perspective, ensuring a unidirectional data flow.  This unidirectional flow makes debugging and understanding the application's state much easier.

### Defining and Passing Props

To pass a prop, you simply add an attribute to the child component's tag in the parent component's template. The attribute name becomes the prop name, and the attribute value becomes the prop value.

**Example:**

Let's say we have a parent component called `ParentComponent` and a child component called `ChildComponent`.

```html
<!-- ParentComponent.vue -->
<template>
  <div>
    <ChildComponent message="Hello from Parent!" :count="myCount" />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent.vue';

export default {
  components: {
    ChildComponent,
  },
  data() {
    return {
      myCount: 10
    };
  }
};
</script>
```

In this example, we're passing two props to `ChildComponent`:

*   `message`: A string with the value "Hello from Parent!".
*   `count`: A number with the value of `myCount` (which is 10). Notice the use of `:count` which is shorthand for `v-bind:count`.  This is essential for passing dynamic data that is bound to a JavaScript expression.

### Receiving Props in the Child Component

To receive props in the child component, you need to declare them using the `props` option.  This option can be an array of strings (for simple cases) or an object (for more complex scenarios with type validation and default values).

**Example:**

```vue
<!-- ChildComponent.vue -->
<template>
  <div>
    <p>{{ message }}</p>
    <p>Count: {{ count }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  props: {
    message: {
      type: String,
      required: true
    },
    count: {
      type: Number,
      default: 0
    }
  }
};
</script>
```

Here, we've declared two props:

*   `message`: Specifies that the prop should be a string and is required. If the parent component doesn't pass this prop, a warning will be shown in the console during development.
*   `count`: Specifies that the prop should be a number and has a default value of 0. If the parent component doesn't pass this prop, the child component will use the default value.

Using the object syntax for `props` allows for type validation, making your components more robust and easier to debug.  Common types include `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, `Array`, `Object`, `Date`, `Function`, `Symbol`, and even custom constructor functions.

### Prop Validation

As seen in the previous example, prop validation helps ensure that components receive the correct data types.  This is crucial for preventing unexpected errors and making your code more maintainable.  Besides `type` and `required`, you can also use custom validators.

**Example:**

```vue
<!-- ChildComponent.vue -->
<template>
  <div>
    <p>Value: {{ value }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  props: {
    value: {
      type: Number,
      validator: function (value) {
        return value >= 0 && value <= 100;
      }
    }
  }
};
</script>
```

In this example, the `validator` function checks if the `value` prop is within the range of 0 to 100. If it's not, a warning will be shown in the console.

### Common Challenges with Props

*   **Forgetting to pass a required prop:** This will result in a warning in the console, but can lead to unexpected behavior if not addressed.  Always double-check that you're passing all required props.
*   **Passing the wrong data type:** This can cause errors or unexpected behavior. Use prop validation to catch these errors early.
*   **Mutating props directly:**  Props are read-only from the child component's perspective. Modifying a prop directly will not update the parent component's state and can lead to unpredictable behavior. If you need to modify the prop's value, you should emit an event to the parent component and let the parent component update its own state.

## Events: Emitting Data Up

Events are a mechanism for child components to communicate with their parent components.  They allow child components to signal that something has happened (e.g., a button click, a form submission, a data change) and pass data back to the parent component.

### Emitting Events

To emit an event, you use the `$emit` method. The first argument is the name of the event, and any subsequent arguments are the data you want to pass to the parent component.

**Example:**

```vue
<!-- ChildComponent.vue -->
<template>
  <button @click="handleClick">Click Me</button>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  methods: {
    handleClick() {
      this.$emit('custom-event', 'Hello from Child!');
    }
  }
};
</script>
```

In this example, when the button is clicked, the `handleClick` method is called. This method emits an event named `custom-event` and passes the string "Hello from Child!" as data.

### Listening to Events

To listen to an event emitted by a child component, you use the `v-on` directive (or its shorthand `@`) on the child component's tag in the parent component's template.

**Example:**

```vue
<!-- ParentComponent.vue -->
<template>
  <div>
    <ChildComponent @custom-event="handleCustomEvent" />
    <p>Received message: {{ receivedMessage }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent.vue';

export default {
  components: {
    ChildComponent,
  },
  data() {
    return {
      receivedMessage: ''
    };
  },
  methods: {
    handleCustomEvent(message) {
      this.receivedMessage = message;
    }
  }
};
</script>
```

In this example, we're listening for the `custom-event` emitted by `ChildComponent`. When the event is emitted, the `handleCustomEvent` method is called, and the data passed by the child component (the message "Hello from Child!") is passed as an argument to the method.  The method then updates the `receivedMessage` data property, which is displayed in the template.

### Event Names

It's best practice to use kebab-case (e.g., `custom-event`) for event names. This ensures consistency and avoids potential issues with case sensitivity.

### Passing Multiple Arguments

You can pass multiple arguments when emitting an event.  These arguments will be passed to the event handler in the order they were emitted.

**Example:**

```vue
<!-- ChildComponent.vue -->
<template>
  <button @click="handleClick">Click Me</button>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  methods: {
    handleClick() {
      this.$emit('data-update', 123, 'some data');
    }
  }
};
</script>
```

```vue
<!-- ParentComponent.vue -->
<template>
  <div>
    <ChildComponent @data-update="handleDataUpdate" />
    <p>Number: {{ number }}, String: {{ string }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent.vue';

export default {
  components: {
    ChildComponent,
  },
  data() {
    return {
      number: 0,
      string: ''
    };
  },
  methods: {
    handleDataUpdate(number, string) {
      this.number = number;
      this.string = string;
    }
  }
};
</script>
```

### `$emit` Validation

Vue provides a way to validate the arguments passed to `$emit`. This is done by defining a `emits` array in your component options.

**Example:**

```vue
<script>
export default {
  emits: ['my-event'],
  methods: {
    handleClick() {
      this.$emit('my-event', 'some data');
    }
  }
};
</script>
```

This tells Vue that the component can emit the `my-event` event.  If you try to emit an event that is not declared in the `emits` array, Vue will issue a warning during development.  For complex validation, you can also use an object syntax similar to prop validation.

### Common Challenges with Events

*   **Forgetting to listen for an event:** If you emit an event but the parent component isn't listening for it, nothing will happen.  Double-check that you've added the `v-on` directive to the child component's tag.
*   **Emitting the wrong event name:** If you emit an event with a different name than the parent component is listening for, the event handler won't be called.  Make sure the event names match exactly.
*   **Incorrect data being passed:** Ensure the data being passed in the `$emit` call aligns with what the parent component expects in the event handler.

## Props and Events Together: Two-Way Binding

While props and events primarily support unidirectional data flow, they can be combined to achieve a form of two-way binding.  This is particularly useful for creating custom input components. The `.sync` modifier has been deprecated in Vue 3, so a more explicit approach is used.

**Example:**

Let's create a custom input component that allows the parent component to control the input's value.

```vue
<!-- CustomInput.vue -->
<template>
  <input :value="modelValue" @input="updateValue" />
</template>

<script>
export default {
  props: {
    modelValue: {
      type: String,
      default: ''
    }
  },
  emits: ['update:modelValue'],
  methods: {
    updateValue(event) {
      this.$emit('update:modelValue', event.target.value);
    }
  }
};
</script>
```

```vue
<!-- ParentComponent.vue -->
<template>
  <div>
    <CustomInput :modelValue="message" @update:modelValue="message = $event" />
    <p>Message: {{ message }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import CustomInput from './CustomInput.vue';

export default {
  components: {
    CustomInput,
  },
  data() {
    return {
      message: ''
    };
  }
};
</script>
```

In this example:

1.  The `CustomInput` component receives a `modelValue` prop, which represents the current value of the input.
2.  When the input's value changes, the `updateValue` method emits an `update:modelValue` event, passing the new value as data.
3.  The parent component listens for the `update:modelValue` event and updates its `message` data property with the new value.

This creates a two-way binding between the parent component's `message` data property and the `CustomInput` component's input value. This pattern is commonly used for creating reusable form components.
