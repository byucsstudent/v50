# Props and Events

Components are the building blocks of modern user interfaces. To create dynamic and interactive applications, components need to communicate with each other. This is where props and events come in. Props allow you to pass data from a parent component to a child component, while events allow a child component to communicate back up to its parent. Mastering props and events is crucial for building reusable and maintainable components.

## Understanding Props

Props (short for "properties") are a mechanism for passing data from a parent component to a child component. Think of them as arguments you pass to a function.  Props are read-only from the child component's perspective; a child component cannot directly modify the props it receives. This unidirectional data flow makes it easier to reason about the state of your application.

### Passing Props

To pass a prop, you include it as an attribute on the child component's tag in the parent component's template.

```html
<!-- Parent Component -->
<template>
  <div>
    <MyComponent :message="parentMessage" :count="5" />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      parentMessage: "Hello from parent!",
    };
  },
};
</script>

<!-- Child Component (MyComponent.vue) -->
<template>
  <div>
    <p>{{ message }}</p>
    <p>Count: {{ count }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  props: {
    message: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
    },
    count: {
      type: Number,
      default: 0,
    },
  },
};
</script>
```

In this example, the parent component is passing two props to `MyComponent`: `message` and `count`.  The `:message` syntax is shorthand for `v-bind:message`, which means the value of the `message` prop is dynamically bound to the `parentMessage` data property in the parent component. The `count` prop is passed directly as a number.

### Declaring Props

Inside the child component, you must declare the props it expects to receive using the `props` option. You can declare props in two ways:

1.  **Simple Array Syntax:**  This is a concise way to declare props if you only need to specify the prop name.

    ```javascript
    export default {
      props: ['message', 'count']
    }
    ```

2.  **Object Syntax:** This provides more control and allows you to specify the prop's type, whether it's required, and a default value. This is the preferred method for most scenarios.

    ```javascript
    export default {
      props: {
        message: {
          type: String,
          required: true,
        },
        count: {
          type: Number,
          default: 0,
          validator: function (value) {
            return value >= 0; // Validate that the value is non-negative
          },
        },
      },
    };
    ```

    *   `type`:  Specifies the expected data type of the prop (e.g., `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, `Array`, `Object`, `Function`, `Symbol`).
    *   `required`:  A boolean indicating whether the prop is required.  If `true` and the prop is not passed, a warning will be emitted.
    *   `default`:  A default value to use if the prop is not passed.  If the default value is an object or array, you must use a factory function:

        ```javascript
        props: {
          myArray: {
            type: Array,
            default: () => [] // Factory function
          }
        }
        ```
    *   `validator`:  A function that allows you to define custom validation logic for the prop.  The function receives the prop's value as an argument and should return `true` if the value is valid, and `false` otherwise.

### Prop Case (kebab-case vs. camelCase)

When passing props from a parent component, you typically use kebab-case (e.g., `my-prop`). However, inside the child component, you access the prop using camelCase (e.g., `this.myProp`). The framework automatically handles the conversion.

### Common Challenges with Props

*   **Prop Mutation:**  Child components should *never* directly modify props.  If a child component needs to change the data, it should emit an event to the parent, and the parent should update its own state.
*   **Type Mismatches:**  Ensure that the data type of the prop you're passing matches the type declared in the child component.  Otherwise, you may encounter unexpected behavior or warnings.
*   **Missing Required Props:**  If a prop is marked as `required`, make sure to pass it from the parent component.
*   **Complex Data Structures:** Passing complex objects or arrays as props can sometimes lead to unexpected reactivity issues if not handled carefully. Consider using immutable data structures or cloning the data before passing it.

## Understanding Events

Events provide a mechanism for a child component to communicate with its parent component.  When something happens in the child component (e.g., a button click, data change), it can emit an event that the parent component can listen for and respond to.

### Emitting Events

To emit an event, use the `$emit` method in the child component.  The first argument is the name of the event, and any subsequent arguments are the data you want to pass to the parent component.

```html
<!-- Child Component -->
<template>
  <button @click="handleClick">Click Me</button>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  methods: {
    handleClick() {
      this.$emit('my-event', 'Hello from the child!');
    },
  },
};
</script>
```

In this example, when the button is clicked, the `handleClick` method is called, which emits an event named `my-event` with the message "Hello from the child!".

### Listening to Events

In the parent component, you can listen for events emitted by the child component using the `v-on` directive (or its shorthand `@`).

```html
<!-- Parent Component -->
<template>
  <div>
    <MyComponent @my-event="handleMyEvent" />
    <p>Message from child: {{ childMessage }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      childMessage: '',
    };
  },
  methods: {
    handleMyEvent(message) {
      this.childMessage = message;
    },
  },
};
</script>
```

Here, the parent component is listening for the `my-event` event emitted by `MyComponent`. When the event is emitted, the `handleMyEvent` method is called, and the message passed from the child component is assigned to the `childMessage` data property.

### Event Arguments

The arguments passed to the `$emit` method in the child component are available as arguments to the event handler in the parent component. In the previous example, the `message` argument in `handleMyEvent` corresponds to the "Hello from the child!" string passed in the `$emit` call.

### Custom Event Names

It's best practice to use kebab-case for custom event names (e.g., `my-event`, `update-value`). This helps to avoid naming conflicts with native HTML events.

### `.sync` Modifier (Framework Specific)

Some frameworks, like Vue.js, offer a `.sync` modifier which provides syntactic sugar for two-way data binding on props. While convenient, it's important to understand that it can sometimes make data flow less explicit.

```html
<!-- Parent Component -->
<template>
  <div>
    <MyComponent :my-value.sync="parentValue" />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      parentValue: 0,
    };
  },
};
</script>

<!-- Child Component -->
<template>
  <button @click="increment">Increment</button>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  props: ['myValue'],
  methods: {
    increment() {
      this.$emit('update:myValue', this.myValue + 1);
    },
  },
};
</script>
```

In this example, `.sync` on `my-value` prop is equivalent to manually listening for the `update:myValue` event and updating the `parentValue` in the parent component.

### Common Challenges with Events

*   **Event Names:** Using inconsistent event names can lead to confusion and make it harder to maintain your code. Stick to a consistent naming convention.
*   **Passing Data:**  Carefully consider what data needs to be passed with the event. Avoid passing large or unnecessary data.
*   **Event Bubbling:**  Be aware of event bubbling, where events propagate up the DOM tree.  You may need to use event modifiers like `.stop` to prevent unintended behavior.
*   **Too Many Events:**  If a child component is emitting a large number of events, it may indicate that the component is doing too much and should be refactored.

## Practical Examples

Let's consider a practical example of a simple counter component.

```html
<!-- Counter Component -->
<template>
  <div>
    <button @click="decrement">-</button>
    <span>{{ count }}</span>
    <button @click="increment">+</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  props: {
    initialCount: {
      type: Number,
      default: 0,
    },
  },
  data() {
    return {
      count: this.initialCount,
    };
  },
  methods: {
    increment() {
      this.count++;
      this.$emit('count-changed', this.count);
    },
    decrement() {
      this.count--;
      this.$emit('count-changed', this.count);
    },
  },
};
</script>

<!-- Parent Component -->
<template>
  <div>
    <Counter :initial-count="10" @count-changed="handleCountChanged" />
    <p>Current count: {{ currentCount }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import Counter from './Counter.vue';

export default {
  components: {
    Counter,
  },
  data() {
    return {
      currentCount: 10,
    };
  },
  methods: {
    handleCountChanged(newCount) {
      this.currentCount = newCount;
    },
  },
};
</script>
```

In this example, the `Counter` component receives an `initialCount` prop and maintains its own internal `count` data property. When the increment or decrement buttons are clicked, the component emits a `count-changed` event with the updated count. The parent component listens for this event and updates its `currentCount` data property accordingly.
