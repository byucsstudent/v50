# Vue Router

Vue Router is the official router for Vue.js. It deeply integrates with Vue's core to make building Single Page Applications (SPAs) a breeze. It allows you to map application URLs to Vue components, enabling navigation without full page reloads. This leads to a smoother, more responsive user experience. Understanding Vue Router is crucial for building complex, multi-view Vue applications.

Essentially, Vue Router manages the mapping between URLs and components. When a user navigates to a specific URL, Vue Router renders the component associated with that URL. This process happens on the client-side, providing the benefits of an SPA.

## Installation and Setup

The first step is installing Vue Router into your Vue project. Using npm or yarn, run the following command in your project's root directory:

```bash
npm install vue-router@4
# or
yarn add vue-router@4
```

We are specifically installing Vue Router version 4, which is compatible with Vue 3.

Next, you need to configure Vue Router in your main application file (usually `main.js` or `main.ts`). This involves importing Vue Router, defining your routes, creating a router instance, and then using that instance in your Vue application.

```javascript
// main.js
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router'
import App from './App.vue'
import Home from './components/Home.vue'
import About from './components/About.vue'

// Define your routes
const routes = [
  { path: '/', component: Home },
  { path: '/about', component: About }
]

// Create the router instance
const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHistory(),
  routes // short for `routes: routes`
})

// Create and mount the app
const app = createApp(App)
app.use(router)
app.mount('#app')
```

In this example:

*   We import `createRouter` and `createWebHistory` from `vue-router`. `createWebHistory` is one of the history modes Vue Router supports.  It uses the browser's history API for clean URLs without the hash symbol (`#`).
*   We define an array called `routes`. Each object in this array represents a route, specifying the `path` (the URL) and the `component` that should be rendered when that path is visited.
*   We create a router instance using `createRouter`, passing in the `history` mode and the `routes` array.
*   Finally, we use the router instance in our Vue application using `app.use(router)` before mounting the app.

## Defining Routes

The `routes` array is central to Vue Router configuration. Each route is an object with at least two properties:

*   `path`: A string representing the URL path. This should start with a forward slash (`/`).
*   `component`: The Vue component to render when the path is matched.

You can also include other properties like `name` (for named routes, making it easier to link to routes programmatically) and `meta` (for storing arbitrary data about the route, such as authentication requirements).

```javascript
const routes = [
  { path: '/', component: Home, name: 'home' },
  { path: '/about', component: About, name: 'about', meta: { requiresAuth: true } }
]
```

## Router Links and Router View

To enable navigation within your application, Vue Router provides two key components: `<router-link>` and `<router-view>`.

*   `<router-link>`:  This is a component that renders an `<a>` tag with the correct `href` attribute.  It's the preferred way to navigate between routes in your application because it leverages Vue Router's internal navigation mechanisms, preventing full page reloads.

    ```vue
    <template>
      <router-link to="/">Home</router-link> |
      <router-link to="/about">About</router-link>
    </template>
    ```

    The `to` prop specifies the destination route. You can use either the path or the name of the route.

*   `<router-view>`:  This component acts as a placeholder where the matched component for the current route will be rendered.  You typically place it in your root component (`App.vue`) or in layout components.

    ```vue
    <template>
      <nav>
        <router-link to="/">Home</router-link> |
        <router-link to="/about">About</router-link>
      </nav>
      <router-view></router-view>
    </template>
    ```

## Dynamic Route Matching

Vue Router allows you to define routes with dynamic segments using the colon (`:`) syntax. This is useful for displaying information based on a specific ID or parameter.

```javascript
const routes = [
  { path: '/user/:id', component: User }
]
```

In the `User` component, you can access the value of `id` using `$route.params.id`.

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>User ID: {{ userId }}</h1>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { useRoute } from 'vue-router';

export default {
  setup() {
    const route = useRoute();
    const userId = route.params.id;

    return {
      userId
    };
  }
}
</script>
```

With Vue 3 and the Composition API, `useRoute` is the preferred way to access route information.

## Nested Routes

For more complex applications, you might need to nest routes. This allows you to create hierarchical relationships between your components and URLs.

```javascript
const routes = [
  {
    path: '/user/:id',
    component: User,
    children: [
      {
        path: 'profile', // No leading slash! Relative to the parent route.
        component: UserProfile,
      },
      {
        path: 'posts',
        component: UserPosts,
      },
    ],
  },
];
```

To display the child routes, you need to add a `<router-view>` component *inside* the parent component (`User` in this case).

```vue
// User.vue
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>User ID: {{ userId }}</h1>
    <nav>
      <router-link :to="{ path: 'profile' }">Profile</router-link> |
      <router-link :to="{ path: 'posts' }">Posts</router-link>
    </nav>
    <router-view></router-view>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { useRoute } from 'vue-router';

export default {
  setup() {
    const route = useRoute();
    const userId = route.params.id;

    return {
      userId
    };
  }
}
</script>
```

## Programmatic Navigation

Sometimes you need to navigate programmatically, for example, after a form submission or when handling an event. You can do this using the `router.push()` method.

```javascript
import { useRouter } from 'vue-router';

export default {
  setup() {
    const router = useRouter();

    const handleSubmit = () => {
      // Perform form submission logic here
      // ...

      router.push('/about'); // Navigate to the about page
    };

    return {
      handleSubmit,
    };
  },
};
```

`router.push()` accepts a string path, a named route object, or a route object with `path` and `query` parameters.  There is also `router.replace()`, which is similar to `router.push()` except that it replaces the current history record instead of adding a new one.

## Named Routes

Named routes provide a convenient way to refer to routes in your application, especially when dealing with dynamic routes or complex URLs.

```javascript
const routes = [
  { path: '/user/:id', component: User, name: 'user' }
]
```

You can then use the name when creating `<router-link>` components or when navigating programmatically.

```vue
<router-link :to="{ name: 'user', params: { id: 123 } }">User 123</router-link>
```

```javascript
router.push({ name: 'user', params: { id: 456 } });
```

## Navigation Guards

Navigation guards are functions that you can use to control access to certain routes. They allow you to perform actions before, during, or after a navigation. Common use cases include authentication, authorization, and data fetching.

Vue Router provides three types of navigation guards:

*   **Global Guards:** These are applied to all routes in your application.
    *   `beforeEach`: Executed before each route is navigated to.
    *   `afterEach`: Executed after each route is navigated to.
*   **Route-Specific Guards:** These are applied only to specific routes.
    *   `beforeEnter`:  Executed before entering a specific route.
*   **Component Guards:** These are defined inside a component.
    *   `beforeRouteEnter`:  Executed before the component is created.  Doesn't have access to `this` because the component instance hasn't been created yet.
    *   `beforeRouteUpdate`:  Executed when the route that renders the component changes, but the component is reused.
    *   `beforeRouteLeave`:  Executed before leaving the component.

Here's an example of a global `beforeEach` guard to check for authentication:

```javascript
// main.js
router.beforeEach((to, from, next) => {
  if (to.meta.requiresAuth) {
    // Check if the user is logged in
    if (isAuthenticated()) {
      next(); // Allow access to the route
    } else {
      next('/login'); // Redirect to the login page
    }
  } else {
    next(); // Allow access to the route
  }
});
```

In this example, if a route has `meta: { requiresAuth: true }`, the guard checks if the user is authenticated. If so, it calls `next()` to allow access. Otherwise, it redirects the user to the login page.  The `next()` function is crucial; it controls the navigation flow.  Calling it without arguments proceeds to the route.  Calling it with a path redirects to that path.  Calling it with `false` cancels the navigation.

## Common Challenges and Solutions

*   **Problem:**  "Blank screen after navigation."  This often indicates an error in your route configuration or component rendering. Check your browser's developer console for error messages.  Ensure that your components are correctly imported and that the `path` properties in your routes match the URLs you're trying to access.
*   **Problem:** "Navigation guard not working as expected." Double-check the order of your navigation guards and ensure that you're calling `next()` correctly.  Make sure your authentication logic is working correctly and that the `meta` properties are correctly defined on your routes.  Use the debugger to step through your navigation guard logic.
*   **Problem:** "Dynamic route parameters not updating."  If you're reusing a component for different dynamic route parameters, you might need to use the `beforeRouteUpdate` component guard to react to changes in the route parameters.
*   **Problem:** "Hash mode vs. History mode."  If you're seeing `#` in your URLs, you're likely using the hash mode.  For cleaner URLs, use the history mode (`createWebHistory`).  However, history mode requires server-side configuration to properly handle SPA routing.  If your server isn't configured correctly, you'll get 404 errors when refreshing the page on a non-root route.  Consult your server's documentation for instructions on how to configure it for SPA routing.
*   **Problem:** "Scroll Behavior." When navigating between routes, the page might not scroll to the top automatically. You can customize the scroll behavior using the `scrollBehavior` option when creating the router instance. Refer to the Vue Router documentation for details.
