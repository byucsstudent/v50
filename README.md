Welcome to v50. A demo course for the features of Mastery LS.

### Question 9: Code Debugging

```masteryls
{"id":"1f44df39-2e37-4849-8fae-6fdb74811c1e","title":"Code Debugging", "type":"multiple-choice", "body":"Consider the following Javascript code snippet. What is the issue, and how would you fix it? \n\n```javascript\nfunction fib(n) {\n  if (n <= 1) {\n    return 1;\n  }\n  return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 1);\n}\n```" }
- [ ] The base case is incorrect; it should return 0 for n = 0.
- [x] The function calls the fib function with `n-1` twice, and should call it with `n-1` and `n-2`.
- [ ] There is no issue; the code calculates the Fibonacci sequence correctly.
- [ ] The function will cause a stack overflow error for small values of `n`.
```
