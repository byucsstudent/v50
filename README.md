{"id":"i9l4k1m0-5j6h-8i9l-2345-6789cdef0123","title":"Code Debugging", "type":"multiple-choice", "body":"Consider the following Javascript code snippet. What is the issue, and how would you fix it? \\n\\n```javascript\\nfunction fib(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) {\\n    return 1;\\n  }\\n  return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 1);\\n}\\n```" }
- [ ] The base case is incorrect; it should return 0 for n = 0.
- [x] The function calls the fib function with `n-1` twice, and should call it with `n-1` and `n-2`.
- [ ] There is no issue; the code calculates the Fibonacci sequence correctly.
- [ ] The function will cause a stack overflow error for small values of `n`.
```
